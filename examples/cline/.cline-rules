- Atmosphere: Please create according to user instructions

- If the input JSON becomes long, it may hit the LLM token limit midway. Therefore, first create the input JSON as a local file, then read it and send it to the MCP server.
- When creating the above JSON, if a JSON that was cut off midway was created, do not start over from the beginning, but try to create it efficiently from where it left off.
  - For example, output will be stable if each track is appended to a JSON file one by one.
